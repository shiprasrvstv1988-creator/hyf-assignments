1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task:
   a) How to make a button change and reset a background image using JavaScript.
   b) How to organize sections in containers to create a clean 2x2 layout.
   c) How to stay focused on my main design plan and not get distracted by too many AI ideas.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?
   I had to correct Copilot’s suggestions when it placed the JavaScript code inside the HTML file. I asked it to create a separate JavaScript file instead, so my code would be cleaner and easier to manage.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
   Using Copilot to generate code is faster because it quickly writes and suggests the next line of codes for me vs. using it as a learning partner helps me understand the code better — how it works, when to use it and explore new ideas.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
   a) I can get lost in all the ideas and information AI gives me.
   b) Sometimes it makes things too complicated, even for simple tasks.
   c) I might not know how to fix things myself if there’s a bug or change needed.
